// Decision workflow: what the renter does once the shortlist exists. Each feature lives in its own module and attaches
// to the shell through a few event-bus hooks in app.js; nothing here changes how the views render.
//   visit.js     "Since your last visit" pill in the stats strip
//   tray.js      the decision tray: a dock with the Compare picks, drag to add and reorder
//   tradeoff.js  the 2-D trade-off pad for the ranking weights
//   share.js     Share shortlist (read-only HTML) and the decision memo
//   tour-plan.js the tour-day planner under Shortlist > Tours
